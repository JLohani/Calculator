# Calculator
A Calculator using HTML CSS and JS that supports Dark Mode.

I came across an article on [de.to](dev.to) regarding this calculator and i thought to make one. So i cloned the repository and studied the code and made few changes in it.
The original github repo is [this](https://github.com/Mohammad-Farmaan/JavaScript-Calculator).
